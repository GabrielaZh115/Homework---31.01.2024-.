            <p class="firstinfo-firstline">Germany is bracing for widespread disruption to rail services after train drivers embarked on a </p>
            <p class="firstinfo">
                record six-day strike Wednesday that will wreak havoc on travel plans, strain supply chains and deal a new blow to the sputtering economy.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="secondinfo-firstline">
                It’s the second time this month that members of Germany’s GDL Union have walked off the job
            </p>
            <p class="secondinfo"> in an ongoing wage dispute with Deutsche Bahn. The state-owned rail operator said the action would cause delays and cancellations to long-distance, regional and city commuter services until Monday. Freight transport will also face “considerable restrictions.”</p>
            <br>
            <p class="thirdinfo-firstline">Pre-booked tickets for travel during the strike will remain valid for future trips, Deutsche Bahn</p>
            <p class="thirdinfo"> added. Passengers can also cancel their booking and receive a full refund. Some commuters expressed frustration at the train drivers’ latest action.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="forthinfo-firstline">  “I’ve always been understanding of strikes of all kinds. But my patience has now run out,” Ilse</p>
            <p class="forthinfo"> Terwey told CNN at Berlin’s main train station. “Nobody wins. Everyone loses. Passengers lose. The economy loses, the (railway’s) image loses.”</p>
            <br>
            <p class="fifthinfo-firstline">  The longest industrial action in Deutsche Bahn’s 30-year history will pile more pressure on</p>
            <p class="fifthinfo"> Germany’s vast manufacturing sector, which is already grappling with high energy costs, supply chain delays, elevated interest rates, and weak domestic and foreign demand. Almost a fifth of all freight in Germany is transported by rail, according to the country’s statistics office.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="sixthinfo-firstline">Industrial production, dominated by manufacturing, contracted 2% last year, the country’s</p>
            <p class="sixthinfo">statistics office said last week. That was a major drag on the economy overall, with gross domestic product falling 0.3% in 2023, likely the weakest performance among Europe’s big countries.</p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p class="firstinfo-firstline">According to Commerzbank chief economist Joerg Kraemer, although the latest disruption could</p>
                <p class="firstinfo"> cost the transport sector “a mere” €30 million ($32.6 million) a day, costs will be much higher “if factories have to reduce their production due to missing supply.”</p>
                <br>
                <p class="secondinfo-firstline">The strike “is straining the nerves of the public” and hurting “the already tarnished reputation of</p>
                <p class="secondinfo"> Germany as a business location,” he added.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="thirdinfo-firstline">Businesses have been scrambling to find workarounds, but industry bodies have already</p>
                <p class="thirdinfo"> warned that these won’t fully offset the disruption, which coincides with bottlenecks caused by attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, one of the world’s main trade routes.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="forthinfo-firstline">The strike represents “a major logistical challenge” for the chemical and pharmaceutical sector,</p>
                <p class="forthinfo"> the German Chemicals Industry Association told CNN.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="fifthinfo-firstline">“The railroads are very important for the industry’s logistics when it comes to supplying raw</p>
                <p class="fifthinfo"> materials, and shipping intermediate and finished products,” added the trade body, whose member companies employ nearly 550,000 people.</p>
